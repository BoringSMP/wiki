## Warp Stone
The Warp Stone item can be used to teleport to Lodestones. It works very similar to a compass, that can be bound to a Lodestone. You can bind a Warp Stone to a Lodestone by right clicking, and then always teleport back to the Lodestone.  
In case the Lodestone gets removed, your Warp Stone will no longer work.

## Diamond Shards
A Diamond Shard is equivilant to 0.25 Diamonds. They exist for the economy, so that you can sell items for cheaper if a Diamond isn't cheap enough.  
They can also be obtained by smelting diamond gear.

## 100% Villager Conversion Rate
Due to the server's difficulty being set to Normal, Villagers would usually only successfully convert to Zombie Villagers 50% of the time. The Mod changes this so that Villagers convert successfully 100% of the time.
